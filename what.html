	  The <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121/dune">1979 Dune Boardgame</a> (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283355/dune">Reimplemented 2019</a>) is a daunting strategy game full of intrigue, schemes, combat and... rules. A lot of rules.<br>
	  While it makes the game more thematic and interesting, it also makes it complicated.<br>
	  Particularly the advanced game mode gives a lot of extra rules that want and need to be remembered.<br> 
	  The advanced combat rules are perceived as a bit finicky, because for most factions, you need to count your troops in half-values, only rising up to full strength by using spice.<br>
	  To add insult to injury, during battles you are composing a "battle-plan" that involves dialing a number on a round dial, slotting a leader into said dial, holding up to 3 cards behind that dial and somewhere storing spice behind that dial. Ain't nobody got handspace for that!<br>
	  <br>
	  Introducing the <b>Digital Battle Wheel</b>, aka the <b>Dune Combat Calculator</b>.<br>
	  Using this site you can:<br>
	  <ul>
	  <li>- Select your faction</li>
	  <li>- Calculate combat strength with the help of an easy to use calculator (Original code by <a href="https://github.com/Erelyks">Erelyks</a>)</li>
	  <li>- Slot your leader (Harkonnen can slot captured leaders, Atreides can activate Kwisatz Haderach)</li>
	  <li>- Select Treachery cards</li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
	  When using a smartphone, you can just show your phone screen when you are done and everything should be easily readable, without any juggling efforts and with less calculation error possibilities.<br>
	  If you find any bugs, have any feature suggestions or just want to get into contact, shoot me a <a href="mailto:david@dunecombatcalculator.com">mail</a>.<br>
	  The code is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/davidscheele/dune-combat-calculator">GitHub</a>.<br>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <big>Todo</big>
	  <ul>
	 <li>- <b>Styling changes</b>: I'm not a web-designer and as such my css stylings may be pretty crap for mobile devices. That could be improved I bet. As it is, it works on my desktop and my mobile phone.</li>
	<li>- <b>Nicer leader icons</b>: The icons that are in it now are fine, but they could be better and for some factions are hard to read. I can't use scans of the original because I would probably run into copyright problems. I want to keep the shape and style of the originals though to help with fast recognition in the game.</li>
	<li>- <b>Basic mode</b>: These options are for advanced mode and that was the whole reason for Erelyks to create the base-page. Now I aspire that this could replace the battle wheel all together and as such it would need a basic mode switch.</li>
